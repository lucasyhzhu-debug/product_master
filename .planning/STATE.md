## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 planning]: All 5 phases skip research-phase (internal system, patterns proven in v1.0)
- [v1.1 planning]: Phase ordering: UIB verification -> API audit -> Order QoL -> Kitchen overhaul -> K3Mart cockpit
- [v1.1 planning]: Single new dependency: date-fns ^4.1.0 for date arithmetic across Order/Kitchen/K3Mart phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pitfall]: GoBiz token cascade can silently fail -- Phase 13 adds sync health monitoring
- [Pitfall]: WIB timezone bugs from fragmented date logic -- centralize in convex/lib/wibDate.ts
- [Pitfall]: K3Mart cockpit stubs have production data -- never change getWeekNumber() algorithm
