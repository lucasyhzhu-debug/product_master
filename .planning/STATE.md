## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0-v1.7 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [55-01] Used CSS variable tokens via inline styles for dark mode (no dark: Tailwind classes) per design spec
- [55-01] Used error tokens (red) for CalloutBox "important" type since no orange status token exists
- [55-02] Used motion.svg + motion.g for staggered node animation, motion.path for edge stroke-dashoffset draw
- [55-02] Reused amber CSS variable tokens for orange color (no dedicated orange status token)
- [55-02] Extracted useActiveSection to src/hooks/ for reusability across future guide pages
- [55-03] Made NavItem.permission optional (non-breaking) so Help nav item needs no permission prop
- [55-03] Eager imports for HelpCenter and GuideRouter (static JSX, no Convex queries)
- [55-03] ProtectedRoute with no permission/role props = auth-only gate for Help routes
- [56-01] Duplicated guide metadata inline in ExpenseGuide.tsx to avoid circular import with helpGuides.ts

### Open Blockers (carried forward)

- GrabFood `orders:read` OAuth2 scope not yet granted -- infrastructure works, 401 handled gracefully
- Crystal and Tamtem GrabFood merchantIDs pending -- only GFSBPOS-254-353 confirmed
- GrabFood grabItemID values per outlet needed for menu toggle activation
- BigSeller COGS = 0 for all Frollie orders -- profit analytics meaningless until configured
