# Project State

## Project Reference
See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)
**Core value:** Production reliability -- single source of truth for recipes, orders, kitchen production, and inventory
**Current focus:** v1.5 Financial Statements -- Phase 32: Income Statement Backend

## Current Position

Phase: 32 of 34 (Income Statement Backend)
Plan: -- (phase not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-02 -- Roadmap created for v1.5 (3 phases, 14 requirements)

Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% -- Roadmap ready, awaiting phase planning

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):** 36 plans, avg 6.3 min, ~3.8 hours total
**Velocity (v1.1):** 27 plans, avg 7.3 min, ~3.3 hours total
**Velocity (v1.2):** 20 plans (Phases 17, 17.1, 18)
**Velocity (v1.4):** 20 plans across 9 phases in 5 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0-v1.4 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.5 design decisions documented in `docs/plans/2026-03-01-income-statement-design.md`:
- Real-time query aggregation (no snapshot tables)
- Consignment folded into unified P&L as another channel
- Full COGS (production + packaging) via BOM resolution
- Confidence indicators as first-class data quality signal
- Unmapped items = honest zero COGS with "missing" flag

### Open Blockers (carried forward)

- GrabFood `orders:read` OAuth2 scope not yet granted -- infrastructure works, 401 handled gracefully
- Crystal and Tamtem GrabFood merchantIDs pending -- only GFSBPOS-254-353 confirmed
- GrabFood grabItemID values per outlet needed for menu toggle activation
- BigSeller COGS = 0 for all Frollie orders -- profit analytics meaningless until configured
